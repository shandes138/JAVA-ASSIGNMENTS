QUESTION 1:- How to create an object in java`?
ANSWER :- There are many ways by which we can create objects of a class in java.In Java a class provides
the blueprint for objects.
 
Different ways to create objects in Java Are:-  
1. Using new keyword
2. Using new instance
3. Using clone() method
4. Using  deserialization;
5. Using newInstance()  method of constructor class 



QUESTION 2:- What is the use of a new keyword in Java`?
ANSWER:- The "new" keyword in Java is used to create an instance of an object. It allocates memory to an object and
returns a reference to the object created. It is used with a constructor to create an object.



        
QUESTION 3:- What are the different types of variables in Java?
ANSWER:- There are three types of variables in java
a.Static Variable
b.Instance Variable
c.Local Variable 



QUESTION 4:- 4. What is the difference between Instance variables and Local variables?
ANSWER:-The difference between instance variable and local variable are as followes:-
A.LOCAL VARIABLE :-
        --> It will be created at the time of object creation and destroyed at the time of object destruction and hence the scope of instace
        is exactly the sae as scope of object.
        --> It is stored in the heap as part of object.
        --> Should be declared within the class directlt but outside of any method or block or constructor.

B.LOCAL VARIABLE:-
        -->They are stored in the stack 
        --> They are created as part of block execution in which it is declared and destroyed once that block execution completes. Hence the scope
         of local variable is exactly the same as the scope of the block in which we declared. 



QUESTION 5:- In which area memory is allocated for instance variable and local variable?
ANSWER:- Instance variables are allocated in the heap and local variables are allocated in the stack.



QUESTION 6:- What is method overloading?
ANSWER:- Method overloading in Java is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name
but different parameters. The Java compiler distinguishes these methods by the number, type, and order of
parameters. Overloading is used to provide multiple ways to call a method for different use cases, making
code more readable and reusable.
